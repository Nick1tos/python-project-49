## Description:

Brain Games consists of 5 mini-games related to simple math.Each game gives you questions to be answered. 
If 3 out of 3 questions answered correctly you win. If you make a mistake game terminates and you have to start over. 

You can play following games:

* Brain-calc
* Brain-even
* Brain-gcd (greatest common divisor)
* Brain-prime
* Brain-progression.

## How to install:

You need to write step-by-step the following commands in your terminal:
1. make install
2. make build
3. make package-install

## How to play

Enter 'make' + game name in the command line to launch.
* For Brain-calc: make brain-calc
* For Brain-even: make brain-even
* For Brain-gcd (greatest common divisor): make brain-gcd
* For Brain-prime: make brain-prime
* For Brain-progression: make brain-progression.
